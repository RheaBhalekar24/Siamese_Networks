Siamese Network README
This is a README file for the Siamese_Network (1).ipynb notebook.

Project Overview
This Google Colab notebook implements a Siamese Network using the PyTorch deep learning framework to perform image similarity learning. The model is trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing and accessories. The primary goal of this network is to learn a representation that can accurately determine if two input images belong to the same class or not. The notebook provides a complete and reproducible example, from data loading to training and evaluation.

Key Components
Custom Dataset Class: The SiameseDataset is a custom PyTorch dataset class that handles the unique data requirements of a Siamese Network. Instead of returning single images, it retrieves pairs of images along with a label indicating if they are from the same class (0) or different classes (1). This is achieved by randomly selecting a second image from the dataset and checking its class label against the first image's label.

Network Architecture: The SiameseNetwork class defines the model's architecture, which consists of a shared convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone followed by a series of fully connected layers.

CNN Backbone: This part of the network is responsible for extracting features from the input images. It includes multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation and MaxPool2d layers to downsample the feature maps.

Fully Connected Layers: After the CNN, the feature maps are flattened and passed through two fully connected layers. These layers transform the features into a low-dimensional embedding space where similar images are close to each other.

Loss Function: The notebook uses a custom contrastive_loss function. This loss function is fundamental to training Siamese networks for similarity learning.

It calculates the Euclidean distance between the outputs of the two image inputs.

For similar pairs, it minimizes this distance.

For dissimilar pairs, it maximizes this distance, up to a defined margin (set to 2.0 in this notebook). This margin ensures that dissimilar images are pushed at least a certain distance apart.

How to Use
Open the Notebook: Open the Siamese_Network (1).ipynb file in a Google Colab environment. The notebook is configured to use a GPU for faster training.

Run All Cells: Execute all the cells in the notebook in their specified order.

The notebook will install necessary libraries.

It will automatically download the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

The model will then be trained over 5 epochs. You'll see the training loss decrease over time in the output.

Review Outputs: After training, the notebook will present a plot of the loss history  to show how the model's performance improved during training. It will also display several pairs of images from the test set, showing the model's ability to measure their similarity by providing a numerical similarity score for each pair. . A high similarity score indicates the model believes the images are similar, while a low score suggests they are different.
